The total missing non-EU migrants is the sum of the difference between
the red and green lines, which is 2,572,000. Since the Migration
Observatory [estimates that the non-EU foreign-born in the UK in 2017
was only about twixe that figure at
5,677,000](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/migrants-in-the-uk-an-overview/),
the 'missing' are 31% of the total non-EU nationals that would be living
in the UK without the expansion of access in 2004. Another way of
putting it, would be to say that the non-EU born population of the UK in
2017 would have been 45% higher than it was.
