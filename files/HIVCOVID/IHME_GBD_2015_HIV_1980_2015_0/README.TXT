Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015) HIV Incidence, Prevalence, and Mortality 1980-2015

The Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015), coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), estimated the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors globally, for 21 regions, and for 195 countries and territories. Estimates for HIV/AIDS incidence, prevalence, and mortality by country, age, and sex for 1980-2015 (quinquennial) are available from the GBD Results Tool. Files available for download in this record include select tables published in The Lancet in July 2016 in "Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and mortality for HIV, 1980-2015: estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015." The tables include estimates of antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage for 2015 and HIV-specific mortality for patients on ART.
