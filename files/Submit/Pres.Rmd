## the problem

- academics need to publish papers in journals 
- writing is hard 
- getting published is harder 
- desk rejections -- where the editors do not send the paper for review -- make up a major proportion of the failures to publish 

## the gap  

- no dedicated software for capturing ideas 
- no trusted systems for ensuring ideas are developed 
- no paper-writing workflow management system that breaks down the problem and also provides an overview of progress 
- few academics realise that editors have style preferences 
- actually submitting a paper can take up to 4-5 hours of formatting and filling out forms 

## the solution 

- dedicated ideas-to-submission software
- project-manages paper writing 
- subscription service includes submission assistance 

## functionality

- innovation capture: ideas / titles in one place 
- to-do list: pulls out the most urgent to-dos based on user's deadlines 
- paper-writing workflow: dashboard for progress 
- templates: created automatically from articles scraped from journals 
- formatting: loaded with automatic formatting requirements for journals 
- pro/subscription: personal support with submission (and re-submission) of papers

## form 

- desk / mobile app 
- quick capture of ideas with topic tags 
- overview mode: where you are overall  
- project mode: breaks-down the act of writing into chunks (sections, paragraphs, sentences -- user can toggle detail level)
- distraction-free writing environment
