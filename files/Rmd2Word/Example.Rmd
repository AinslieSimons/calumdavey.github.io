# Famous people in public health  
## John Snow 

John Snow is famous for, among other things, working out that *cholera was waterborne* [@Snow:1856]. He was an English physician and a leader in the development of anaesthesia and medical hygiene. He is considered one of the fathers of modern epidemiology, in part because of his work in tracing the source of a cholera outbreak in Soho, London, in 1854. 

## Florence Nightingale 

Florence Nightingale was an English social reformer and statistician, and the founder of modern nursing [@Nightingale:1992]. Nightingale came to prominence while serving as a manager and trainer of nurses during the Crimean War, in which she organised care for wounded soldiers. She gave nursing a favourable reputation and became an icon of Victorian culture, especially in the persona of "The Lady with the Lamp" making rounds of wounded soldiers at night.

## Michael Marmot 

Michael Marmot led the Whitehall studies, which showed that socioeconomic *class inequalities can be bad for your health* (when you're at the **bottom**, not the top!) [@Marmot:1991]. He is Professor of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London.

## Doll and Bradford-Hill

Along with others, these two lead studies that supported the idea, controversial at the time, that smoking is bad for you [@Doll:1950], causing: 

- Lung disease 
- Heart disease
- Yellow teeth
- Bad breath

We could generate a table with R, as was done for the table below.

## Table 2: cycling deaths in London

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Load the data
p <- read.csv('pedal-cyclist-casualties-ksi.csv')

# Include the table 
knitr::kable(p[,1:6])
```

## Figure 2: plot of deaths 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=3}
par(oma = c(.1,.1,.1,.1), mai=c(.85,.85,.1,.2))
plot(p$Year, p$Serious, type='l', bty='n', col='blue',
     ylab = 'Number of cases',
     xlab = 'Year',
     ylim = c(0, max(p$Serious)))
lines(p$Year, p$Fatal, col='red')
legend(1990,400,legend = c('Serious injury', 'Fatality'), col=c('blue', 'red'), lty=1, bty='n', cex=.8)
