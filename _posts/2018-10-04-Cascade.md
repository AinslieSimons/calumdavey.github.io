title: Serrated Cascade
tags: hiv r cascade graphs 
---

The idea that populations of people living with HIV 'cascade' over the steps towards controlling the virus with medication -- testing, initiating treatment, suppressing the virus by adhering to the correct treatment -- has been around for a [long time](https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-programming/treatment/cascade). 

Increasingly interventions are being tested that aim to reduce the number of people with infectious HIV in a population. HIV prevalence has been added so that the cascade describes everyone in the population (whether living with HIV or not). The 'outcome' of evaluations of these interventions is how the cascade has changed overall, and so we used a very simple 'serrated cascade' to show this in a recent paper looking at the [effect of an intervention for female sex workers in Zimbabwe](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352301818301115). The graph looked like this:

In this case, the HIV prevalence did not change much over time, so the [UNAIDS' '90:90:90' targets](http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/documents/2017/90-90-90) where pretty much the same from the start to the end of the trial. 

In another study looking before-after the introduction of services for sex workers in Zimbabwe, the HIV prevalence did change quite a bit in some places we we needed to adapt the picture. We added indicators for the 90:90:90 targets at the start and the end of the period, but we were never sure how well this worked (we also didn't have viral load data this time, but we did show the 95% confidence intervals in grey):

Is this a good way of looking at the (HIV-related) health of a population? It captures a lot, but focusing on the treatment cascade ignores the degree of susceptibility of HIV-negative people in the population (e.g. the use of PrEP). Changing susceptibility will eventually be reflected in the HIV prevalence, but slowly and mixed-in with the changes in levels of treatment. Perhaps it would be possible to show the '[prevention cascade](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352301816300637?via%3Dihub)' data on the same graph? 

Below is the data and the R code used to make the second of these graphs. Feel free to use the code (but please reference [Cowen *et al* 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352301818301115), thanks!)
