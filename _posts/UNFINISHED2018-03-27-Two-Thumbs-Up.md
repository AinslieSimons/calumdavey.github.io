title: Two thumbs up 
---

In a recent post on the World Bank Development Blog, Berk Ozler remarked on how socially positive outcomes ('cash transfers solve poverty!') grab more headlines than finding to the contrary. A 'round-up' of the latest research in economics in Africa was posted on the same blog a few days before, and I was struck at the time by how positive the messages were. 

In light of Berk's blog, below is a summary of the proportions of the headlines which were positive, categorised by topic. I've interpreted socially positive to be headlines where the effect reported seems like a good thing to me -- I don't think any are at all controversial. I've also recorded how often the headline appears to be *methodologically* positive: that is, when the headline sounds certain of the findings. 

| Topic | N | n socially positive (%) | n methodologically positive (%) |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Agriculture | 6 | 1 | 6 |
| Conflict | 4 | 1 | 4 |
| Credit, savings, risk, insurance | 12 | 1 |  |
| Education |  |  |  |
| Electricity |  |  |  |
| Firms |  |  |  |
| Health and nutrition |  |  |  |
| Households and networks |  |  |  |
| Institutions|  |  |  |
| Political economy |  |  |  |
| Poverty and inequality |  |  |  |
| Using evidence to inform policy |  |  |  |
