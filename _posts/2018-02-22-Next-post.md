More text, more things. The chief executive of the lecturers’ pension scheme at the centre of a university strike received a 17% pay rise worth an extra £82,000 this year.

Bill Galvin’s pay package had risen from £484,000 to £566,000, said a spokeswoman for the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS).

Running costs for the university pension scheme were over £124m per year - including two staff earning over £1m.

Mr Galvin has described the pension scheme as “excellent value”.

The pensions scheme now has a £6bn deficit and striking lecturers say that plans to tackle the shortfall will cut their retirement income by £10,000 per year.
