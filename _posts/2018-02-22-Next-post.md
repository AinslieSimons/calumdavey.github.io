Hi. This is my first post on my very own [Git Hub](https://github.com) based [Jekyll-powered](https://jekyllrb.com) website. It took me a little while to patch it together from [things that I mostly understand](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) on the internet. If you would like to make your own site, you're very welcome to 'fork' from my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/calumdavey/calumdavey.github.io) (not as horrible as it sounds -- useful introduction [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)), and get into using git for managing your work (or at least your website). Final piece of the set-up: I am using [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer/) with [markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com), both of which are simple and great to use.
