title: Blog titles -- 2020 
---

Around ~~four months~~ 18 months too late, I'm finally making good on a NY resolution (the resolution that keeps on giving) and getting a list of the blogs that I want to get out of my head. Ideally, I'll work through one a week, adding more to the top as I go. In ~~no particular~~ order of appearance:

1. Lean out 
1. Here's my CU
1. The LHS of the TOC 
1. Thresholds: when more informative? 
1. Starting rules and stopping rules in RCTs 
1. *Something* is imbalanced in this randomisation 
1. Baseline *p*-values 
1. What do we learn from evaluation?
1. ITT [See Patricia email]
1. Crisis -- buying time 
1. What do we mean when we say it 'doesn't work'? [p109\*]
1. Supply equalling demand when demand is paid for by suppliers 
1. What does effectiveness mean?
1. NICE [p188]
1. Ethics of a strong IV; Embedded encouragement [p205] and IV for investigating mechanisms, Afghan report 
1. Caring economy; you didn't build that 
1. Cartwright and B-H
1. If it doesn't generalise, what *do* we know?
1. Complexity and postmodernism 
1. Fish vs how to fish: context-centred design [p28]
