Around four months too late, I'm finally making good on a NY resolution and getting a list of the blogs that I want to get out of my head. Ideally, I'll work through one a week, adding more to the top as I go. In no particular order:

- Lean out 
- Here's my CU
- Advantage of expected earnings = American Dream?
- Thresholds: when more informative? 
- Starting rules and stopping rules in RCTs 
- *Something* is imbalanced in this randomisation 
- Anatomy of violence 
- Baseline *p*-values 
- Making distinctions 
- Name: problems with counting things 
- ITT [See Patricia email]
- Crisis -- buying time 
- What do we mean when we say it 'doesn't work'? [p109\*]
- Supply equalling demand when demand is paid for by suppliers 
- What does effectiveness mean?
- NICE [p188]
- Ethics of a strong IV; Embedded encouragement [p205]
- IV for investigating mechanisms, Afghan report [p205]
- Caring economy; you didn't build that 
- Cartwright and B-H
- If it doesn't generalise, what *do* we know?
- Complex vs complicated 
- Complexity and postmodernism 
- The LHS of the TOC 
- Fish vs how to fish: context-centred design [p28]
