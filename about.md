I have been working as an epidemiologist at the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk) since  2011, on projects relating to HIV, sex work, stepped-wedge trials, education, and mental health. I teach on an MSc course on Evaluation methods that I co-founded with my supervisor, James Hargreaves. For more information see my [LSHTM profile](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/davey.calum), [Google Scholar account](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=pm4eXUEAAAAJ&hl=en), or view my [CV](cv.pdf) (pdf).
