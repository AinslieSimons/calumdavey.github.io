---

I have been working as an epidemiologist at the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk) since  2011, on projects relating to HIV, sex work, stepped-wedge trials, education, and mental health. I'm one of the deputy directors of the [Centre for Evaluation](http://evaluation.lshtm.ac.uk/). Recently, I've worked with the [Education Endowment Foundation](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/), and with the [Centre of Excellence for Development Impact and Learning (CEDIL)](https://cedilprogramme.org/). My current position is with the [PENDA](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres-projects-groups/penda) project, learning about interventions to improve inclusion of people with disabilities in development projects. 

I'm interested in the evaluation of interventions for public health and development. I try to focus on interventions that address up-stream social determinants of health and wellbeing. I'm still trying to develop a systems perspective, both for the interventions being evaluated but also the way we view wellbeing and how policy decisions are made. 

I teach on an MSc course on Evaluation methods that I co-founded with my supervisor, James Hargreaves.

Please feel free to contact me at [calum.davey@lshtm.ac.uk](calum.davey@lshtm.ac.uk). I sporadically waste an afternoon pointlessly arguing on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CalumDavey?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), and otherwise re-tweeting links and comments from people more informed or hilarious than me.
